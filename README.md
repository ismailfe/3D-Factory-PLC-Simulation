The first Desktop application of 3D factory simulation prepared for PLC training. Many training studies have been carried out with this simulation program. The application is prepared on the Unity Platform. It can communicate with the outside world via SQL TCP/IP Profinet. It is not possible for me to share because some of the source codes are still used commercially. It can communicate with Siemens S7-1500, S7-1200, S7-400, S7-300 series PLCs and also Tia Portal and Step7 Sim. It can work with programs without the need for a PLC.
